# Simple Page Builder

Hi my name is `SIMON` and this is a Simple build tool for REALLY simple pages.

# Installation
    npm i [-g|-D|-S] @puresamari/spb

# CLI

Once the `spb` cli is installed you can use the cli.

## Building

    spb [build] <out> <files...>
The `out` dir will contain all files and the `files` are the compiled files

For example:
- `$ spb dist hello-world.ts index.html styles.css`
